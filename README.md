![Lots of TODO's!!!!!](http://f.cl.ly/items/1j0C132h2y1D433d1C1G/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-17%20at%2012.50.33.png "Lots of TODO's!!!!!!!")

## Description

I love todos. These don't fit inside my ['annoyances'](https://github.com/swmcc/annoyances) so much. These are mini 'todo' items.

For example today my todo's are:

 - Go get my phone from my car
 - Correct chart to display proper information
 - Write README for todo app


Harldy worth putting in my annoyances list as they aren't really project related. They usually fit inside my 50/10 pomodoro.

## Geek Stuff

I wanted to use [Angular](http://angularjs.org/) for a project and thought this would be a fit for it. After a bit of reading
I decided to use [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) to give me a helping hand - it comes with bower, grunt and other nice apps that just aid your workflow.   

## Development Info

Make sure Yeoman is installed as it will get you all the nice stuffs you need :)

```
git clone https://github.com/swmcc/todo.git
cd todo 
grunt server
```

## Todo

 - Get persistant storage working properly (I just hold them in the session for now)
 - The sortable feature isn't working probably due to some jQuery
 - Deploy to heroku and wrap around OAuth
